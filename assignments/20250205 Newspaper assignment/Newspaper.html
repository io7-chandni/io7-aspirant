          There was a feel good factor and a festive fervour all around. With
          the abrogation of Article 370 and PEACEFUL Eid in the country and in
          Kashmir especially, it was enough reason for the Central government to
          heave a sigh of relief.On Monday night, when people feasted on the
          occasion of Eid, entire India watched ONE THING...in common... that's
          right, PM Narendra Modi's Man vs Wild programme with Bear Grylls on
          Discovery Channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shot some time back, the show was aired on the action channel at 9pm
          on Monday.PM Modi who is known for his physical fitness and being a
          regular on the Yoga mat, stunned millions of Indians as he embarked on
          a rare adventure in Uttara-khand's Jim Corbett National Park with Bear
          Grylls in a special episode of Man Vs Wild.
        </p>

        <p>
          The show revealed some interesting anecdotes on how PM Modi used to
          create bathing salts from dew as a child, or his "rendezous" with
          wild-life during childhood.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the show, when Bear pointed out the dangers lurking in their
          vicinty, PM Modi fearlessly said,"We should not take this place as a
          danger zone. When we go against nature then everything become
          dangerous."
