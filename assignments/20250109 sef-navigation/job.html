          According to my profile, my brand's story started with my sister's
          Sailor Moon VHS tapes. Those tapes eventually led me to create content
          centered around anime and different “nerdy” entertainment aspects. My
          brand's story is unlike any other, and the same goes for yours. No two
          companies have the same founding story or reason for existing. Your
          history and values are integral parts of your brand positioning
          strategy, and a company profile is a place to mention this information
          without seeming like you're talking someone's ear off. 2. Can Justify
          a Higher Price Point A company profile is a perfect opportunity to
          show the work that goes on behind the scenes, thus justifying why your
          prices may be higher than others in your industry. For example, luxury
          fashion house Prada's company profile emphasizes the company uses raw
          materials that are meticulously sourced and exclusively produced for
          the fashion house. This creates a sense that you're paying more for
          higher-quality items. It also explains why I can never afford them. 3.
          Builds Your Reputation My content creator profile emphasizes that I've
          been an anime fan since childhood and shows how I developed my skills
          for years as a journalist. My audience knows I'm an experienced
          creator who also happens to be a total nerd. My audience trusts I'll
          provide quality content rooted in my passion for the medium. It's a
          reputation I hold dearly. Think about what you want your company's
          reputation to be. Is your company the one that started as a small
          family-owned shop that grew into a billion-dollar enterprise?
