          In today’s fast and competitive world, we often get time for
          ourselves. Over time, our schedule gets very dull and monotonous. That
          is why we need to indulge in something
          <img src="image.jpg" style="float: right" width="100px" alt="" /> in
          between to keep our minds fresh and active. What’s better than a hobby
          for this? One of the main benefits of having a hobby is that it is a
          major stress-buster. You actually enjoy doing it and it satisfies your
          soul.

          In other words, without a hobby, your life becomes an unhealthy cycle
          lacking any excitement or spark. Hobbies offer you a great opportunity
          to take a break and forget the worries of your life. They allow you to
          explore yourself and realize your potential in different areas.
          Moreover, hobbies can also be a source of extra income. For instance,
          if you like painting, you can actually sell your art to make some
          extra money. Likewise, if you have a knack for dancing, you may teach
          dance classes to people on your holidays. This way your hobby a
          benefit you both spiritually and financially as well.

          Moreover, dance also taught me how to stay strong and push my limits.
          I have had many injuries while dancing, too many bruises and cuts but
          that didn’t stop me from pursuing it further. In fact, it pushes me to
          do my best and realize my potential more than ever. I have enrolled in
          dancing classes because I wish to make my hobby my career. I feel we
          all should do things which we enjoy doing. Everyone is running after
          money and in this race, they give up their likings and preferences. I
          have learned from this race and decided to not take part in it. I wish
          to take the road less traveled by and take on challenges most people
          don’t dare to. In short, my hobby of dancing makes me feel alive and
          well. It is the only thing I look forward the most to. Thus, I hope to
          achieve my dream of being a professional dancer and making way for
          people who wish to make careers out of their hobbies.

          My favourite hobby is cooking. I love to cook on holidays. I like to
          try out new and unique cuisines from different places around the
          world. It improves my knowledge not only about the vegetation and food
          habits of the people in that particular area, but it also let me know
          the type of vegetation there. I usually prefer to cook fresh
          vegetables with sauces and other ingredients, which are healthy, easy
          to prepare and looks good to serve. More often than not I also like to
          prepare different kind of desserts from various parts around the
          world. Some of the notable dishes that I have prepared are Mexican
          corn Tortillas, avocado and salsa; white bean peasant soup that
          belongs to Italy. All you have to do is gather the information from
          the internet, there is a lot of information available there and gather
          all the necessary ingredients and prepare a fresh and delicious dish.

          Since childhood, I have developed an interest for drawing and love to
          make sketches, filling a white sheet of paper with life and colors. I
          don’t know what prompted me towards drawing; nevertheless it is my
          favourite pastime and my favourite hobby. Drawing has many mental
          benefits apart from improving your drawing skills with every new
          sketch you make. It improves your imagination as your mind constantly
          juggles through the thoughts of making new figures and filling it with
          colors. To draw a sketch in detail you need to be focused and keep
          your mind concentrated, eliminating any kind of external distraction.
          The attention to detail that you put in the drawing will require all
          your imagination and concentration. The ability to concentrate while
          doing a particular job stays with you always in other works as well.
          Drawing is good for the development of the brain and hand-eye
          coordination. You will constantly think new thins to draw and
          immediately start giving it shape on paper, working your eyes, brain
          and hand in synchronization. Drawing is a wonderful hobby which could
          be fun and in my opinion everyone should take up drawing as a pass
          time activity if not a full time hobby.
